            The seven islands that constitute Mumbai were originally home to
            communities of Marathi language speaking Koli people, who originated
            in Gujarat in prehistoric times.[25][26][27] For centuries, the
            islands were under the control of successive indigenous empires
            before being ceded to the Portuguese Empire and subsequently to the
            East India Company when in 1661 Charles II of England married
            Catherine of Braganza and as part of her dowry Charles received the
            ports of Tangier and Seven Islands of Bombay.

            Mumbai (English: /mʊmˈbaɪ/, Marathi: [ˈmumbəi]; also known as Bombay
            /bɒmˈbeɪ/, the official name until 1995) is the capital city of the
            Indian state of Maharashtra. According to United Nations, as of
            2018, Mumbai was the second-most populous city in India after Delhi
            and the seventh-most populous city in the world with a population of
            roughly 20 million.[16] As per Indian government population census
            of 2011, Mumbai was the most populous city in India with an
            estimated city proper population of 12.5 million living under
            Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai.[17] Mumbai is the centre of
            the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, the sixth most populous metropolitan
            area in the world with a population of over 23 million.[18] Mumbai
            lies on the Konkan coast on the west coast of India and has a deep
            natural harbour. In 2008, Mumbai was named an alpha world
            city.[19][20] It has the highest number of millionaires and
            billionaires among all cities in India.[21][22] Mumbai is home to
            three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the Elephanta Caves, Chhatrapati
            Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, and the city's distinctive ensemble of
            Victorian and Art Deco buildings.[23][24]

            During the mid-18th century, Bombay was reshaped by the Hornby
            Vellard project,[29] which undertook reclamation of the area between
            the seven islands from the sea.[30] Along with construction of major
            roads and railways, the reclamation project, completed in 1845,
            transformed Bombay into a major seaport on the Arabian Sea. Bombay
            in the 19th century was characterised by economic and educational
            development. During the early 20th century it became a strong base
            for the Indian independence movement. Upon India's independence in
            1947 the city was incorporated into Bombay State. In 1960, following
            the Samyukta Maharashtra Movement, a new state of Maharashtra was
            created with Bombay as the capital.[31]
