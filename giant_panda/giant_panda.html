                <p>The panda, with its distinctive black and white coat, is adored by the world and considered
                a national treasure in China.This bear also has a special significance for WWF because
                it has been our logo since our founding in 1961.Pandas live mainly in temperate forests high
                in the mountains of southwest China, where they subsist almost entirely on bamboo.
                They must eat around 26 to 84 pounds of it every day, depending on what part of the bamboo
                they are eating. They use their enlarged wrist bones that function as opposable thumbs.
                A newborn panda is about the size of a stick of butter—about 1/900th the size of its 
                mother—but females can grow up to about 200 pounds, while males can grow up to about 
                300 pounds as adults. These bears are excellent tree climbers despite their bulk.
                CRUCIAL ROLE IN FORESTS
                The biological diversity of the panda’s habitat is unparalleled in the temperate world and rivals 
                that of tropical ecosystems, making the giant panda an excellent example of an umbrella species
                 conferring protection on many other species where pandas live. In other words, when we protect
                  pandas, we invariably protect other animals that live around them, such as multicolored
                   pheasants,the golden monkey, takin, and crested ibis.</p>
